# How to Create a Blog Post
Hey Mike, so to create a blog post (the easier way possible) is to do the following:
* Copy and Clone one of the existing news HTML page in the `news/` category
* Update `<span class="name"> ____ </span>` to change title
* To update text, go under `.main-news` and change the `<p>` tag
