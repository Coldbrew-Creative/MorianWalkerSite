          <p><b>Three-star recruit Morian Walker is a two-way athlete on the West Coast. He discusses the latest in his recruitment and recaps his unofficial visit to Fresno State.<br><br></b></p>
          <div>
            <p dir="ltr">San Jose (Calif.) Valley Christian athlete <a href="http://www.scout.com/player/185038-morian-walker" target="_blank">Morian Walker</a> was a recruit on the rise this summer and now he has had interest continue to pick up in his senior season. The two-way athlete is getting looked at for his skills at running back as well as in the defensive secondary.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">Walker is spending most of his time on offense this season due to personnel, but has packages to play in the secondary when needed. At 6-foot-1.5 and 215 pounds he projects as either a big back or DB who can play corner or safety.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">He has nine touchdowns on the season, six on the ground and three receiving. Walker most recently showed his abilities on both sides of the ball last weekend with both a rushing touchdown and an interception to help VCHS improve to 5-1 on the season.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">Walker currently holds one offer – <a href="http://www.scout.com/college/wyoming" target="_blank">Wyoming</a> was the first to extend the scholarship.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">“They came up to two of my spring ball practices,” Walker said. “They came up to one of them where I was just working out with the team. They liked me there. I talked with coach Curt Mallory, he’s the safety coach up there. He came the following week and saw me do a lot of football related stuff, doing drills and 7-on-7, and that’s where I got my offer.”<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">Also showing interest in the Bay Area talent are <a href="http://www.scout.com/college/fresno-state" target="_blank">Fresno State,</a><a href="http://www.scout.com/college/boise-state" target="_blank">Boise State</a>, <a href="http://www.scout.com/college/colorado" target="_blank">Colorado,</a> and<a href="http://www.scout.com/college/nevada" target="_blank">Nevada.</a><br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">Wyoming is recruiting him as a safety while Boise State and Nevada are looking at him at running back. Fresno State is recruiting him for both sides.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">He recently took an unofficial visit to Fresno State for the Bulldogs’ Oct. 10 matchup versus Utah State to learn more about the program. What stood out most to him was his interactions with the coaching staff and the family environment around the program.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">“I had a lot of fun,” Walker said. “I enjoyed myself. It was the homecoming game and there was a lot of energy from the fans and the student section… They were giving me a tour of the weight room and I saw (Coach Early) peek out and I got to shake his hand and introduce him to my mother. Coach Antoine, I saw him when I was checking in and he gave me some love. Coach Woodson, I saw him too.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">“I felt like they really did show me a lot of love when I came up there and that’s really what I liked about it… I really want to look at a school that’s really family oriented and everyone is bonded really well. That’s what I was impressed by with Fresno State.”<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">Though the Bulldogs were blown out in the Mountain West contest, it did not hinder his experience on the trip.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">“I knew they said they are in a rebuilding year, so it’s not like you can expect so much in that stage – it’s hard for any school to get W’s when they are in that stage and they are using new recruits and a lot of young guys are playing,” Walker said. “But that doesn’t really effect me in what I see in them. It’s not really how they are doing now, but how they will do in the future when I’m there. As long as I can play and make a difference, that’s really what I want to do.”<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">Walker also has a former high school teammate on the Bulldog roster – kicker Kody Kroening. The two caught up before the game. Senior linebacker Jamaal Rose is also a Valley Christian alumni.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">“(Kroening) was telling me about the school and how much he enjoys it,” Walker said.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">Ultimately when it comes to his decision, playing time, along with the family atmosphere, will play the biggest role in his decision.<br><br></p>
            <p dir="ltr">“It depends on where the colleges need me at,” Walker said. “I like both positions, offense and defense, just the same. It’s not like I’m leaning to any side. Wherever I can play and as soon as I can play, that’s probably where I’ll go.”</p>
